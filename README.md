# SimSpan: Contrastive Learning for Image Similarity

## Objective

To replicate and extend a deep learning model using a contrastive learning framework for the task of image similarity. The underlying model learns meaningful visual representations through self-supervised learning techniques, enabling accurate similarity measurements between image pairs.

## Acknoledgement

The current methodologies were highly relied on the work of [1].
